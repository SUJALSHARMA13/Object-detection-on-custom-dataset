An object detection project using a custom dataset of pedestrian road images annotated with MakeSense.ai, employing YOLOv4 for real-time detection capabilities, and using OpenCV for visualizing the results:

Object Detection using YOLOv8 on Custom Pedestrian Road Images
This repository contains an object detection project focused on detecting pedestrians on road images using YOLOv8, trained on a custom dataset annotated with MakeSense.ai. OpenCV is utilized for visualizing the detection results.

# Overview
Object detection plays a crucial role in computer vision applications, particularly in scenarios like pedestrian detection for autonomous driving or surveillance systems. This project aims to leverage YOLOv8, known for its efficiency and accuracy in real-time object detection, to identify pedestrians in images captured from road scenes.

# Features
Custom Dataset: The dataset consists of annotated pedestrian road images downloaded from Google and annotated using MakeSense.ai, providing bounding box annotations around pedestrians.

YOLOv8 Model: YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection model, is employed to detect pedestrians in the images due to its real-time capabilities and high accuracy.

Visualization with OpenCV: OpenCV is used to visualize the detection results, overlaying bounding boxes and class labels on the original images.
